# Project Overview
# The Fitness Training App is a Python-based project designed for individual students to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The student will develop a fitness app that allows users to create and manage workout routines, track progress, and monitor their personal fitness journey.
#
# Learning Objectives
# Understand and implement core OOP concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
# Learn how to design a system that manages multiple components (users, exercises, workouts, progress).
# Practice organizing Python code into multiple modules and maintaining clear, reusable class structures.
# üöÄ Project Requirements
# Python Version: Python 3.8 or above.
# Libraries: No external libraries required (optional: you can use datetime for tracking dates).
# Version Control: Encourage the use of Git/GitHub to manage the project.
# Key Functionalities
# User Profile Management: Create, update, and view personal fitness profiles.
# Workout Plans: Build, edit, and view personalized workout routines (sets, reps, rest times).
# Exercise Library: Maintain a list of exercises with descriptions and difficulty levels.
# Progress Tracking: Track workout completion and monitor progress over time.
# Workout Reports: Generate reports showing workout history and statistics.
# Project Breakdown and Classes
# 1. User Class (Handles User Profiles)
# Description: The User class will store and manage information about the user, such as their personal details, fitness goals, and workout history.
#
# Attributes:
#
# name: User‚Äôs name.
# age: User‚Äôs age.
# weight: User‚Äôs current weight (kg).
# height: User‚Äôs height (cm).
# goal: The user‚Äôs fitness goal (e.g., "Lose weight", "Build muscle").
# workout_history: A list of completed workouts.
# Methods:
#
# update_weight(new_weight): Update the user‚Äôs weight.
# update_goal(new_goal): Change the user's fitness goal.
# log_workout(workout): Add a completed workout to the workout history.
# display_info(): Display the user's profile information.
# Example:
#
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight, height, goal):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
        self.height = height
        self.goal = goal
        self.workout_history = []

    def update_weight(self, new_weight):
        self.weight = new_weight

    def update_goal(self, new_goal):
        self.goal = new_goal

    def log_workout(self, workout):
        self.workout_history.append(workout)

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, Weight: {self.weight}kg, Height: {self.height}cm, Goal: {self.goal}"
# 2. Exercise Class (Handles Individual Exercises)
# Description: The Exercise class represents individual exercises in the app, storing details like the exercise name, description, and difficulty.
#
# Attributes:
#
# name: Name of the exercise (e.g., "Squat", "Push-Up").
# description: A short description of how to perform the exercise.
# difficulty: Difficulty level of the exercise (e.g., "Easy", "Moderate", "Hard").
# Methods:
#
# display_exercise(): Return a formatted string with exercise details.
# Example:
#
class Exercise:
    def __init__(self, name, description, difficulty):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.difficulty = difficulty

    def display_exercise(self):
        return f"{self.name} ({self.difficulty}): {self.description}"
# 3. Workout Class (Handles Workout Plans)
# Description: The Workout class represents a workout routine that includes a list of exercises. Each exercise is associated with the number of sets, repetitions, and rest time.
#
# Attributes:
#
# name: The name of the workout (e.g., "Full Body Workout").
# exercises: A list of exercises included in the workout. Each exercise will store the sets, reps, and rest time.
# Methods:
#
# add_exercise(exercise, sets, reps, rest_time): Add an exercise to the workout.
# remove_exercise(exercise_name): Remove an exercise from the workout by name.
# view_workout(): Display all exercises in the workout, with sets, reps, and rest times.
# Example:
#
class Workout:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.exercises = []

    def add_exercise(self, exercise, sets, reps, rest_time):
        self.exercises.append({'exercise': exercise, 'sets': sets, 'reps': reps, 'rest_time': rest_time})

    def remove_exercise(self, exercise_name):
        self.exercises = [ex for ex in self.exercises if ex['exercise'].name != exercise_name]

    def view_workout(self):
        print(f"Workout: {self.name}")
        for ex in self.exercises:
            print(f"{ex['exercise'].name}: {ex['sets']} sets, {ex['reps']} reps, {ex['rest_time']} seconds rest")
# 4. ProgressTracker Class (Tracks User Progress)
# Description: The ProgressTracker class tracks the user‚Äôs workout completion over time and can generate reports on workout progress.
#
# Attributes:
#
# user: The user whose progress is being tracked.
# Methods:
#
# log_workout(workout): Add a completed workout to the user‚Äôs workout history.
# generate_report(): Generate a report summarizing the user‚Äôs workout history and statistics (e.g., number of workouts completed).
# Example:
#
class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, user):
        self.user = user

    def log_workout(self, workout):
        self.user.log_workout(workout)

    def generate_report(self):
        total_workouts = len(self.user.workout_history)
        return f"{self.user.name} has completed {total_workouts} workouts."
# Suggested Project Workflow
# Step 1: Set Up the User Profile
# Create an instance of the User class.
# Allow the user to input their personal information (name, age, weight, height, fitness goal).
# Implement the ability to update their weight and fitness goal as time goes on.
# Step 2: Build the Exercise Library
# Create a list of Exercise objects to represent different exercises (e.g., squats, push-ups, lunges).
# Ensure each exercise has a name, description, and difficulty level.
# Step 3: Create Workout Plans
# Create the Workout class to build routines from the exercises in the library.
# Allow users to add exercises to their workout plans with sets, reps, and rest times.
# Implement the ability to view and modify workouts.
# Step 4: Track Progress
# Implement the ProgressTracker class to log completed workouts for the user.
# Allow users to track their progress over time and generate reports showing workout history and statistics.
# Step 5: Add a Menu System
# Create a basic text-based interface that lets the user navigate through the options:
# View Profile: Display user information.
# Edit Profile: Update weight or fitness goal.
# View Exercises: Display all available exercises.
# Create/Modify Workouts: Build and view workout routines.
# Track Progress: Log workouts and view progress reports.
